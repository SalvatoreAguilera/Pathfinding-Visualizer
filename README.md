# Description and Inspiration
I built this as my first Javascript project, it took a lot of time and work and I got most of my inspiration from clementmihailescu pathfinder and https://pathfindout.com/ .
I chose this project because I found it very interesting and at the time impossible for someone like me who could barely center a div. While I was building this project I was taking a data-strcuture and algorithm course at CSUB,
so this project really help me understand the concepts and get an A in my class.

# Algorithms
It has 4 algorithms that you can chose to visualize.

**DFS-Depth-First-Search** 
- This is the worst algorithm out of all 4 for finding the shortest path and it is unweighted.

**BFS/Breadth-First-Search** 
- This algorithm does provide the shortest path and it is unweighted.

**Dijkstra's**
- This algorithm is weighted and it is a great algorithm for finding the shortest path.

**A*Search**
- A* is the one of the best algorithms for finding the shortest path, it uses Heuristics to find the shortest path(weighted).

# Other Functionalities
**Walls**
- Left click to add walls.
- Right click to removes walls.

**Draggable End and Start Node**
- The start node and end are draggable.

**Maze**
- The maze button generates a random maze.
